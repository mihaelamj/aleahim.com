# Build Your Server and Client From One OpenAPI Spec

I help teams ship a fully integrated OpenAPI workflow—designing the spec, generating a Vapor server, and producing Swift clients that share the same contracts. The workflow comes straight from the ExtremePackaging + OpenAPI reference implementation, adapted to fit your stack.

## What We Assemble Together

- **OpenAPI schema design and modular folder layout** powered by YamlMerger
- **Automated Swift OpenAPI Generator pipeline** with shared models, clients, and server stubs
- **Vapor-based API server** that mirrors your spec with production-style logging and validation
- **Concurrency-safe Swift client** featuring logging, auth, and request correction middleware
- **Testing strategy** covering local server and remote environments so regressions get caught early

## Engagement Options

### Architecture Hour • starting at €80/hour
Targeted pairing on spec design, generator setup, or module layout decisions.

*Need a quick-turn review? Priority sessions land at €100–€130/hour.*

### Build Day • €640/day
Hands-on implementation sprint to wire the OpenAPI toolchain into your codebase.

### Delivery Week • €2,800/week
End-to-end engagement that ships the server, client, middleware, and tests with your team.
