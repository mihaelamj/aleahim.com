            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>In the world of <strong>OpenAPI-driven Swift servers</strong>, visibility is everything.<br>You can’t fix what you can’t see — and you can’t optimize what you don’t understand.</p><p>When I started building modular, OpenAPI-first architectures in Swift, one thing stood out: <strong>logging was either overwhelming or absent</strong>.<br>Either you got a raw dump of everything (headers, binary data, and stack traces), or you got nothing at all. Neither is particularly helpful when debugging or tracing an issue across microservices.</p><p>Frameworks like <strong>OpenAPIRuntime</strong> and <strong>OpenAPIVapor</strong> provide a strong foundation, but they deliberately avoid opinions about logging. They leave that up to you.<br>And that’s where most developers end up adding scattered <code>print()</code> statements or ad-hoc <code>logger.info()</code> calls inside handlers just to see what’s going on.</p><p>That’s not clean architecture. It’s noise.</p><p>So I built <strong>OpenAPILoggingMiddleware</strong>, a small, composable middleware that gives you <em>just enough visibility</em> — not too much, not too little — when working with OpenAPI-based servers.</p><hr><h2 id="the-problem-logging-in-a-generated-world">The Problem: Logging in a Generated World</h2><p>OpenAPI code generation has revolutionized how backend systems are written. You define your contracts, generate both server and client, and everything should “just work.”<br>But once requests start flowing, visibility often becomes a blind spot.</p><p>If you’ve ever tried debugging an OpenAPI-generated Swift server, you might recognize these problems:</p><ul><li>Middleware logs every byte of the body, even binary data.</li><li>Multi-part and SSE requests produce unreadable noise.</li><li>Response logs are buried under system output.</li><li>There’s no consistent way to see request duration or endpoint performance.</li><li>You can’t easily toggle verbosity levels or redact sensitive data.</li></ul><p>You end up either drowning in log output or adding <code>print</code> calls just to survive the debugging process.</p><p>This middleware solves that.</p><hr><h2 id="the-solution-a-lightweight-logging-layer">The Solution: A Lightweight Logging Layer</h2><p><code>OpenAPILoggingMiddleware</code> sits quietly in the pipeline — between your generated routes and the transport layer.<br>It listens to every incoming request and outgoing response, measures duration, and prints a <strong>structured summary</strong> of what happened.</p><p>At its core, the idea is simple:</p><blockquote><p>Log exactly what you’d want to see if you were reading someone else’s code.</p></blockquote><p>Here’s how it looks in your Vapor or OpenAPI setup:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">import OpenAPILoggingMiddleware

app.middleware.use(OpenAPILoggingMiddleware(level: .info))
</code></pre><p>That one line transforms your debugging experience.</p><hr><h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the Hood</h2><p>The middleware implements the <code>OpenAPIMiddleware</code> protocol, which lets it intercept the lifecycle of each OpenAPI operation — before the request is handled and after the response is sent.</p><p>Here’s a conceptual overview:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">public struct OpenAPILoggingMiddleware: OpenAPIMiddleware {
    public func intercept(
        _ request: Request,
        operationID: String,
        next: (Request) async throws -&gt; Response
    ) async throws -&gt; Response {
        let start = Date()
        let response = try await next(request)
        let duration = Date().timeIntervalSince(start) * 1000

        print("[\(request.method)] \(request.url.path) -&gt; \(response.status.code) [\(Int(duration)) ms]")
        return response
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Of course, the real implementation handles errors, structured formatting, and configurable verbosity, but the essence is the same:<br>it’s a <em>transparent layer of introspection</em> that doesn’t alter your data flow.</p><hr><h2 id="logging-philosophy">Logging Philosophy</h2><p>There’s a fine balance between too much and too little information.</p><p>Traditional logging tools either <strong>dump everything</strong> (which nobody reads) or <strong>show too little</strong> (which leaves you guessing).<br><code>OpenAPILoggingMiddleware</code> follows a <em>minimalist</em> principle inspired by Apple’s own frameworks — log what matters, hide what doesn’t.</p><p>It’s designed around three key ideas:</p><ol><li><strong>Contextual logging</strong> — every entry includes method, path, status, and duration.</li><li><strong>Progressive verbosity</strong> — higher log levels show headers and bodies.</li><li><strong>Human readability first</strong> — logs are meant to be scanned, not parsed by machines.</li></ol><p>Here’s an example of what a single request looks like in <code>.info</code> mode:</p><pre><code class="language-text">[POST] /mocks/messages/agent-responses (200 OK)
Duration: 123 ms
Body: {"message":"You shall not pass!"}
</code></pre><p>And at <code>.debug</code> level, you get more detail:</p><pre><code class="language-text">[POST] /mocks/messages/agent-responses
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  Authorization: Bearer Gandalf-Was-Here-1
Duration: 123 ms
Body: {"message":"You shall not pass!"}
</code></pre><p>Readable. Structured. Useful.</p><hr><h2 id="why-not-just-use-vapor-s-logger">Why Not Just Use Vapor’s Logger?</h2><p>That’s a valid question.</p><p>Vapor already includes a powerful logging system based on SwiftLog, so why add another layer?<br>Because Vapor’s logger is <strong>request-agnostic</strong> — it’s not aware of OpenAPI operations, generated endpoints, or typed models.</p><p><code>OpenAPILoggingMiddleware</code> is <strong>contract-aware</strong>.<br>It sits in the OpenAPI pipeline, so it can access the operation ID, typed body, and structured response — all without touching your route handlers. That distinction is crucial for OpenAPI-based architectures, where most of your server logic is generated.</p><hr><h2 id="integration-examples">Integration Examples</h2><p>Adding it to a Vapor-based OpenAPI server is trivial:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">import Vapor
import OpenAPIRuntime
import OpenAPIVapor
import OpenAPILoggingMiddleware

let app = try Application(.detect())

let server = try! MyOpenAPIServer(app: app)

app.middleware.use(OpenAPILoggingMiddleware(level: .info))
try app.run()
</code></pre><p>If you’re using <code>OpenAPIRuntime</code> directly (without Vapor), it’s equally simple:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">var server = try OpenAPIServer()
server.middleware.append(OpenAPILoggingMiddleware(level: .debug))
try server.start()
</code></pre><p>No configuration files. No dependencies. It just works.</p><hr><h2 id="extensibility-and-customization">Extensibility and Customization</h2><p>Logging needs vary between environments.<br>In development, you might want to see every detail. In production, you want concise summaries. The middleware supports multiple log levels, allowing you to tailor verbosity to your needs:</p><ul><li><code>.error</code> — log only failed requests.</li><li><code>.info</code> — log all requests with method, path, duration, and status.</li><li><code>.debug</code> — include headers and bodies.</li></ul><p>In future releases, I plan to add <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>formatters</strong> — so you could, for instance, redact specific headers (<code>Authorization</code>, <code>Cookie</code>) or export logs in JSON format for ingestion into a centralized system.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let middleware = OpenAPILoggingMiddleware(
    level: .debug,
    redactHeaders: ["Authorization", "Cookie"]
)
</code></pre><hr><h2 id="design-details-why-simplicity-wins">Design Details: Why Simplicity Wins</h2><p>Many logging libraries start small and end up as frameworks. They introduce dependency graphs, adapters, output sinks, configuration DSLs — and complexity sneaks in through the back door.</p><p>I deliberately avoided that path.</p><p><code>OpenAPILoggingMiddleware</code> does one thing: <strong>it shows what your OpenAPI server is doing</strong>.<br>Nothing else.</p><p>No JSON serialization frameworks. No dependency injection. No external configuration.<br>Just clean Swift and a single dependency on <code>OpenAPIRuntime</code>.</p><p>The codebase is small enough to read in one sitting — and that’s intentional. In my opinion, <strong>you should be able to understand every line of code that runs in your server’s core path</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id="performance-considerations">Performance Considerations</h2><p>Logging always comes at a cost, but the impact here is minimal.<br>The middleware measures request duration using <code>Date().timeIntervalSince(start)</code>, which is negligible compared to network latency or I/O.</p><p>You can safely keep it enabled even in staging or pre-production environments.<br>In production, switching to <code>.error</code> mode will keep your logs clean while still providing visibility into failures.</p><hr><h2 id="testing-and-debugging">Testing and Debugging</h2><p>The middleware is fully testable using Vapor’s <code>Application</code> test harness or plain <code>XCTest</code> with mock requests.<br>Here’s a simple test that validates duration and structure:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">func testMiddlewareLogsRequestAndResponse() async throws {
    let app = Application(.testing)
    app.middleware.use(OpenAPILoggingMiddleware(level: .info))
    try await app.test(.POST, "/ping", afterResponse: { res in
        XCTAssertEqual(res.status, .ok)
    })
}
</code></pre><p>You can also inject your own logger conforming to <code>LogHandler</code> if you prefer structured output rather than printing to stdout.</p><hr><h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2><p>The roadmap includes:</p><ol><li><strong>JSON Formatter</strong> — for structured logs in production environments.</li><li><strong>Redaction Rules</strong> — for headers and sensitive body fields.</li><li><strong>Metrics Hooks</strong> — integration with Swift Metrics or Prometheus.</li><li><strong>Pluggable Output Destinations</strong> — allowing streaming to files or external monitoring systems.</li><li><strong>Async Logging</strong> — offloading logging I/O to background tasks for ultra-high performance scenarios.</li></ol><p>Each of these will follow the same guiding principles: clarity, composability, and minimalism.</p><hr><h2 id="philosophy-clean-visibility">Philosophy: Clean Visibility</h2><p>Logging is not just a developer tool — it’s part of the interface between humans and systems.<br>A well-designed logging layer doesn’t scream for attention; it quietly reveals how the system behaves.</p><p>When I was designing this package, I thought about the elegance of Apple’s own frameworks — the way their APIs feel inevitable, obvious in hindsight. That’s what I aim for here: <strong>a logging middleware that feels invisible until you need it, and indispensable once you use it.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="example-output-in-context">Example Output in Context</h2><p>Here’s a real-world example of multiple concurrent requests hitting the same endpoint:</p><pre><code class="language-text">[GET] /user/profile (200 OK)
Duration: 87 ms

[POST] /mocks/messages/agent-responses (200 OK)
Duration: 121 ms
Body: {"message":"You shall not pass!"}

[PATCH] /user/preferences (204 No Content)
Duration: 96 ms
</code></pre><p>Notice how easy it is to see patterns — which endpoints are slow, which ones are frequent, which ones failed.<br>That’s the essence of <strong>observability</strong> — not more data, but <em>useful</em> data.</p><hr><h2 id="real-world-use">Real-World Use</h2><p>I use <code>OpenAPILoggingMiddleware</code> in all my OpenAPI projects — from small prototypes to complex SSE (Server-Sent Events) systems. It’s particularly valuable when debugging <strong>streamed responses</strong> or <strong>multipart form uploads</strong>, where conventional logs become unreadable.</p><p>Because it’s a simple <code>OpenAPIMiddleware</code>, it works with any generated server conforming to the OpenAPI ecosystem — including custom transports and pure SwiftNIO backends.</p><hr><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2><p>This middleware is a reminder that sometimes the simplest tools make the biggest difference.<br>It’s easy to underestimate the power of <strong>well-designed visibility</strong> — until you remove it and start guessing again.</p><p>Whether you’re debugging mock routes, profiling API latency, or simply curious about what your server is doing, <code>OpenAPILoggingMiddleware</code> gives you that quiet transparency every developer deserves.</p><p>👉 <strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/mihaelamj/OpenAPILoggingMiddleware" target="_blank">mihaelamj/OpenAPILoggingMiddleware</a></p><hr><p><em>“Clean code should be composable, testable, and visible when it runs.”</em></p>
