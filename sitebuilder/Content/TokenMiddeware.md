# Building a Concurrency-Safe Bearer Token Middleware for Swift OpenAPI Clients

Authentication is one of those things that every API client needs, yet implementing it cleanly and safely can be surprisingly trickyâ€”especially in Swift's modern concurrency world. Today, I'm sharing a lightweight middleware solution that handles Bearer token authentication for OpenAPI-generated Swift clients in a thread-safe, composable way.

## The Problem

When working with OpenAPI Runtime in Swift, you often need to:

- Inject an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header into API requests
- Update tokens dynamically (after login, token refresh, etc.)
- Skip authentication for certain endpoints (like login or public routes)
- Ensure thread-safety in concurrent environments

While this sounds straightforward, getting it right with Swift 6's strict concurrency checking requires careful design. You need proper actor isolation, Sendable conformance, and a clean API that doesn't fight the type system.

## The Solution: BearerTokenAuthenticationMiddleware

I built `BearerTokenAuthenticationMiddleware`â€”a minimal, zero-dependency package that solves these problems elegantly. Here's what makes it special:

### 1. Actor-Isolated Token Storage

The heart of the middleware is a private `TokenStorage` actor that manages the authentication token:

```swift
private actor TokenStorage {
    var token: String?

    func getToken() -> String? {
        token
    }

    func setToken(_ newToken: String?) {
        token = newToken
    }
}
```

This ensures that token reads and writes are **never concurrent**, eliminating race conditions completely. The actor isolation guarantee means you can safely update tokens from anywhere in your app without worrying about data races.

### 2. Clean, Composable API

Setting up the middleware is straightforward:

```swift
import OpenAPIRuntime
import BearerTokenAuthMiddleware

let authMiddleware = BearerTokenAuthenticationMiddleware(
    initialToken: "my-secret-token"
)

let client = Client(
    serverURL: URL(string: "https://api.example.com")!,
    transport: AsyncHTTPClientTransport(),
    middlewares: [authMiddleware]
)
```

Every request now automatically includes `Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token`.

### 3. Selective Authentication

Not all endpoints need authentication. Public endpoints like `/login`, `/register`, or `/healthcheck` shouldn't send tokens. The middleware supports this via a `skipAuthorization` closure:

```swift
let authMiddleware = BearerTokenAuthenticationMiddleware(
    initialToken: "my-token",
    skipAuthorization: { operationID in
        ["login", "register", "healthcheck"].contains(operationID)
    }
)
```

The closure receives the `operationID` from your OpenAPI spec and returns `true` to skip the header injection. Simple, flexible, and type-safe.

### 4. Dynamic Token Updates

Tokens expire. Users log out and back in. The middleware handles runtime token updates safely:

```swift
await authMiddleware.updateToken("new-access-token")
```

Because the storage is actor-isolated, this update is guaranteed to be thread-safe. The next request will automatically use the new token.

## How It Works Under the Hood

The middleware conforms to OpenAPIRuntime's `ClientMiddleware` protocol and intercepts every outgoing request:

```swift
extension BearerTokenAuthenticationMiddleware: ClientMiddleware {
    public func intercept(
        _ request: HTTPRequest,
        body: HTTPBody?,
        baseURL: URL,
        operationID: String,
        next: (HTTPRequest, HTTPBody?, URL) async throws -> (HTTPResponse, HTTPBody?)
    ) async throws -> (HTTPResponse, HTTPBody?) {
        // Skip if the operation is public
        if skipAuthorization(operationID) {
            return try await next(request, body, baseURL)
        }

        var modifiedRequest = request

        // Inject the Bearer token
        if let token = await storage.getToken() {
            modifiedRequest.headerFields[.authorization] = "Bearer \(token)"
        }

        return try await next(modifiedRequest, body, baseURL)
    }
}
```

The flow is:

1. Check if this operation should skip authentication
2. If not, retrieve the token from actor-isolated storage
3. Inject it into the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix
4. Pass the modified request down the middleware chain

## Real-World Integration

Here's how it fits into a production API client alongside other middlewares like logging:

```swift
import OpenAPIRuntime
import OpenAPIAsyncHTTPClient
import OpenAPILoggingMiddleware
import BearerTokenAuthMiddleware

public actor ApiClient {
    public var client: Client

    public init(environment: ServerEnvironment) async throws {
        let authMiddleware = BearerTokenAuthenticationMiddleware(
            initialToken: await ApiClientState.shared.token,
            skipAuthorization: { operationID in
                await ApiClientState.shared.isPublicOperation(operationID)
            }
        )

        let loggingMiddleware = LoggingMiddleware(
            appName: "MyAPI",
            logPrefix: "ðŸšš APIClient: "
        )

        let serverURL = try environment.getURL()
        client = Client(
            serverURL: serverURL,
            transport: AsyncHTTPClientTransport(),
            middlewares: [loggingMiddleware, authMiddleware]
        )
    }
}
```

Middlewares compose naturallyâ€”each one does its job and passes control to the next. Logging, authentication, error correction, and custom logic all work together seamlessly.

## Why This Design?

You might wonder: why not just use a simple `var token: String?` property with a lock? A few reasons:

1. **Swift 6 Concurrency**: Actors provide compile-time guarantees that manual locks can't. The compiler ensures you can't accidentally bypass the isolation.

2. **Sendable Conformance**: The middleware struct itself can be safely shared across concurrency domains because the mutable state is isolated in an actor.

3. **Ergonomics**: No need to manually manage locks, semaphores, or dispatch queues. The actor model handles it all.

4. **Future-Proof**: As Swift's concurrency story evolves, actor-based code will continue to work well with new features and improvements.

## Installation

Add the package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/mihaelamj/BearerTokenAuthMiddleware.git",
    from: "1.0.0"
)
```

Then add it to your target dependencies:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(
            name: "BearerTokenAuthMiddleware",
            package: "BearerTokenAuthMiddleware"
        )
    ]
)
```

## Wrapping Up

Building authentication middleware might seem like boilerplate, but doing it rightâ€”especially with modern Swift concurrencyâ€”requires thoughtful design. `BearerTokenAuthenticationMiddleware` provides:

- Thread-safe token management via actors
- Selective authentication with operation-level control
- Dynamic token updates
- Zero dependencies
- Clean composition with other middlewares

If you're building Swift clients for OpenAPI specs and need a robust, concurrency-safe way to handle Bearer tokens, give it a try. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mihaelamj/BearerTokenAuthMiddleware), and I'd love to hear your feedback.

Happy coding!
