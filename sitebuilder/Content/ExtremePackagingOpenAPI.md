When I first published [ExtremePackaging](https://github.com/mihaelamj/ExtremePackaging), the goal was simple — to prove that **highly modular Swift architectures** can scale across platforms while keeping build times fast, dependencies isolated, and the mental model crystal clear.

But then came the next step: *Could this same architecture host a complete OpenAPI workflow — with generated clients, servers, and full middleware integration — without losing its elegance?*

That’s how the new reference implementation, **swift-openapi-extremepackaging-example**, was born.

---

## 🧩 The Foundation — ExtremePackaging

The original ExtremePackaging repository introduced a clean, layered structure:

- **Shared packages** for models and protocols  
- **Independent feature modules** for UI, data, and networking  
- **No cross-package leaks**  
- **Unified Xcode workspace** that felt like a monolith but built like microservices  

The guiding philosophy: *Each feature should be an island, communicating only through well-defined contracts.*

That foundation made it ideal for integrating OpenAPI-generated code — which naturally fits into modular boundaries like `SharedApiModels`, `ApiClient`, and `ApiServer`.

---

## 🚀 Evolving Toward OpenAPI

The OpenAPI version added an entire new layer of automation and functionality — transforming a static architecture into a **living, self-describing API ecosystem**.

### 1. OpenAPI Schema & Code Generation

At the heart of the project is the **OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`)** — defining endpoints, models, and responses for a DummyJSON-compatible API.

Newly introduced elements:

- 🧱 Full schema definitions for `Users`, `Posts`, `Products`, `Todos`, and `Carts`
- 🧩 Error schemas (404, validation, authentication)
- ⚙️ Integration with **Swift OpenAPI Generator**  
- 🔁 Automatic generation of clients, models, and server stubs
- 📦 Separation of generated code into `SharedApiModels`

This turned the architecture into a self-contained API ecosystem — one that can **generate, serve, and consume** its own endpoints.

---

### 2. API Server Implementation

A complete **Vapor-based local server** (`ApiServer`) was added to simulate real-world backend behavior:

- 17 endpoints fully implemented from the OpenAPI spec  
- Realistic mock data mirroring DummyJSON  
- Pagination and validation logic  
- Centralized error responses  
- 🖥️ Prefixed logging for easy tracing in the console  

The server runs locally at `http://localhost:8080`, serving as both a mock backend and a test harness for the generated client.

---

### 3. Enhanced API Client Architecture

The client evolved from a simple abstraction into a **fully concurrent, actor-based networking layer**.

#### Highlights

- `ApiClient` actor manages shared state safely across async contexts  
- Middleware chain introduced: **Logging → Authentication → Correction**  
- Runtime environment switching between `.production`, `.local`, and `.mock`  
- Shared singleton `ApiClientState` stores token, settings, and preferences  

Example flow:

```swift
try await ApiClient.initializeShared(environment: .production)
let client = ApiClient.shared!
let auth = try await client.login(username: "emilys", password: "emilyspass")
await ApiClient.setToken(auth.accessToken)
let users = try await client.getUsers(limit: 10)
```

A clear separation between environment configuration and runtime state ensures deterministic, thread-safe behavior.

---

### 4. Middleware Integration

The client leverages two reusable middlewares from sibling packages:

- **[OpenAPILoggingMiddleware](https://github.com/mihaelamj/OpenAPILoggingMiddleware)**  
  Provides structured, console + JSON logging with full request/response capture.

- **[BearerTokenAuthMiddleware](https://github.com/mihaelamj/BearerTokenAuthMiddleware)**  
  Manages JWT token injection with a concurrency-safe actor and public operation rules.

Together, they demonstrate the power of **middleware chaining** in OpenAPI Runtime — clean, modular extensions without inheritance or global state.

---

### 5. YAMLMerger — The Key to Structured API Specs

The project uses **[YamlMerger](https://github.com/mihaelamj/YamlMerger)** — a Swift package that merges multiple YAML files into a single combined OpenAPI specification.  
If your project doesn’t already include an `openapi.yaml`, YamlMerger ensures you have one — and helps you maintain a **structured, predictable folder layout** under `Tests/` or `Sources/SharedApiModels/schemas/`.

#### 🧠 Why It Must Be Copied into the Project

YamlMerger cannot simply be added as a SwiftPM dependency for build-time merging because of **SPM’s read-only resolution model**:

1. Swift Package Manager stores dependencies in a **cached, read-only** location (`.build/checkouts/`).  
2. The OpenAPI generator, however, needs **write access** to output the merged `openapi.yaml` file directly into your source tree.  
3. SPM build scripts are not allowed to write to source folders outside their sandboxed build directory.

✅ **Solution:** Copy the YamlMerger executable directly into your project (e.g. `Tools/YamlMerger/`) and call it from a pre-build script or CI pipeline.  
This guarantees write permissions and makes the tool available to everyone checking out the repo.

#### 🧩 What It Does

YamlMerger scans subdirectories (01 → 08) and merges YAML fragments in deterministic order:

1. Folders are processed numerically.  
2. `__*.yaml` files merge first within each folder.  
3. Remaining files merge alphabetically.  
4. The final output is a complete OpenAPI spec, suitable for Swift OpenAPI Generator.

#### 🧱 Example Schema Layout

```
Schema/
├── 01_Info/
├── 02_Servers/
├── 03_Tags/
├── 04_Paths/
├── 05_Webhooks/
├── 06_Components/
├── 07_Security/
└── 08_ExternalDocs/
```

Each folder corresponds to a section of the OpenAPI spec, allowing multiple developers to work on different endpoints, schemas, or components without conflicts.

#### ⚙️ Typical Workflow

```bash
# Merge schemas before build
./Tools/YamlMerger merge   --input Sources/SharedApiModels/schemas/   --output Sources/SharedApiModels/openapi.yaml
```

You can run this manually, in a pre-build phase, or as part of CI/CD automation.

#### 💡 Pro Tip

If your project starts **without** an `openapi.yaml`, placing schema fragments in structured folders under `Tests/` ensures your API structure remains organized — even before full code generation.  
YamlMerger gives your tests (and your teammates) a **shared, visual map** of your API’s evolving shape.

---

### 6. Test Coverage Expansion

Two new test suites validate both local and production APIs:

- 🧪 `ApiClientLocalTests.swift` — 25 tests targeting the local Vapor server  
- 🌐 `ApiClientProductionTests.swift` — 29 integration tests against DummyJSON API  

Tests cover:
- Authentication and token persistence  
- Pagination behavior  
- Error responses and invalid IDs  
- Concurrent request handling  

Together they form a **54-test safety net** proving both architecture and OpenAPI compliance.

## 🧠 Architecture Snapshot

```
Packages/
├── Sources/
│   ├── ApiClient/
│   ├── ApiServer/
│   └── SharedApiModels/
└── Tests/
    └── ApiClientTests/
```

Each target is self-contained — just like in the original ExtremePackaging — but now with full OpenAPI integration, client/server symmetry, and end-to-end testability.

## 🧭 Lessons Learned

1. **OpenAPI fits perfectly into modular Swift architectures** — generated code belongs in its own layer, and SwiftPM makes that separation effortless.  
2. **Actors are the future of shared state** — simple, safe, and transparent.  
3. **Middleware > Managers** — function composition scales better than class hierarchies.  
4. **Automation beats documentation** — with OpenAPI, the spec *is* the documentation.

## 💬 Closing Thoughts

This evolution of ExtremePackaging into a full OpenAPI reference app is more than a demo — it’s a **blueprint for modular API-driven development in Swift**.

From YAML schemas to live servers and typed clients, everything now exists in one unified, testable ecosystem — powered by Apple’s official OpenAPI tools and guided by the ExtremePackaging philosophy.
