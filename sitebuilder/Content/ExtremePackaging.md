# ExtremePackaging

A Modular Architecture Methodology for Swift Projects
By Mihaela Mihaljevic

![](/images/xpack/extreme_packaging_1.png)

## Introduction

**Extreme Packaging** is a methodology for structuring Swift projects with *maximal modularity and minimal responsibility per module.*
Each module represents a single, isolated unit of logic — small enough to reason about, easy to test, and replaceable without side effects.

The core idea is **separation**:
modules depend on stable interfaces, not on each other’s implementations. This enables scalable architectures that remain flexible as projects evolve, while keeping build times short and dependencies explicit.

**Table Of Contents:**

- [Part 1 — Project Setup](#part-1--project-setup)
- [Part 2 — Tooling](#part-2--tooling)

### Goals

- Promote clean boundaries between domains and features
- Enable independent development and testing per package
- Simplify refactoring and dependency management
- Keep compilation fast and the architecture transparent

### Process

The repository is organized into **stages**, each representing a self-contained checkpoint in the project’s evolution.
When moving between stages — especially when reverting to earlier ones — always reset and clean your workspace to ensure it matches the intended state.

Here’s the example for **stage 01**:
```bash
# Ensure you're on the branch you want
git checkout stage/01-init-packages

# Fetch the latest version
git fetch origin

# Reset your branch to the remote version
git reset --hard stage/01-init-packages

# Delete untracked files and directories
git clean -fdx
```

### Philosophy

In most projects, modularization is an afterthought — introduced when the codebase becomes too large to manage.
**Extreme Packaging** inverts that approach: modularization is the starting point.
By treating each package as an autonomous component from day one, you gain clarity, resilience, and a foundation that naturally scales with complexity.

## Part 1 — Project Setup

The first step in **Extreme Packaging** is establishing a clear and reproducible project structure that can evolve gradually through defined stages.
Each stage in the repository builds upon the previous one — from the initial package setup, to workspace creation, and finally to adding the app target that ties everything together.

### Overview

The project begins as a **Swift Package Manager–based structure**, designed for modularity from the start.
At its core is a single `Packages` directory that houses all functional modules (such as `AppFeature`, `SharedModels`, and later others).
Every addition to the project — whether a new feature, UI layer, or platform target — is layered on top of this foundation in small, trackable increments.

Here is the link to the project used:
[https://github.com/mihaelamj/ExtremePackaging](https://github.com/mihaelamj/ExtremePackaging/tree/stage/01-init-packages "Initial Structure")

### 1.1 Stage 01 — Initialize Packages

#### Purpose

This stage ensures a working, self-contained Swift package that compiles and passes initial linting checks.

#### Parts

At **stage/01-init-packages**, the repository contains:
- A minimal **package structure** with `Sources` and `Tests`

- **Core configuration file**s:
  - `.swiftlint.yml` for linting rules
  - `.swiftformat` for consistent formatting
  - `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`

- **Two base modules**:
  - `AppFeature` — serves as the entry feature for the app
  - `SharedModels` — holds simple model definitions

#### Folder Structure snapshot

Example folder structure:
![](/images/xpack/Screenshot%202025-03-31%20at%2017.07.23.png)

Inside the  folder:
```bash

➜  ExtremePackaging git:(main) ✗ ls -all
 .
 ..
 .git
 .gitignore
 .swiftformat
 .swiftlint.yml
 Apps
 LICENSE
 Packages
 README.md
```

Inside the `Packages` folder:
```bash
➜  ExtremePackaging git:(main) cd Packages
➜  Packages git:(main) ls -all
 .
 ..
 Package.swift
 Sources
 Tests
```
  
Inside the `Apps` folder:
```bash
.
..
.gitkeep
```


#### Basic Package Code:

I start with package structure like this:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Main",
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v17),
        .macOS(.v14),
    ],
    products: [
        .singleTargetLibrary("AppFeature"),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint", exact: "0.52.3"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "AppFeature",
            dependencies: [
                "SharedModels",
            ]
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "AppFeatureTests",
            dependencies: [
                "AppFeature"
            ]
        ),
        .target(
            name: "SharedModels"
        )
    ]
)

// Inject base plugins into each target
package.targets = package.targets.map { target in
    var plugins = target.plugins ?? []
    plugins.append(.plugin(name: "SwiftLintPlugin", package: "SwiftLint"))
    target.plugins = plugins
    return target
}

extension Product {
    static func singleTargetLibrary(_ name: String) -> Product {
        .library(name: name, targets: [name])
    }
}
```
#### Dummy Files


##### AppView

```swift
import SharedModels
import SharedViews
import SwiftUI

public struct AppView: View {
    public var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Extreme Packaging!")
                .font(.title)
                .fontWeight(.bold)
                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
```
##### DummyModel

```swift
import Foundation

public struct DummyModel: Identifiable {
    public var id: UUID = .init()
    public var title: String
    public init(
        id: UUID = .init(),
        title: String
    ) {
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
    }
}
```
#### Stage 01-init-packages

Here’s the code for **stage 01**:

```bash

# Clone repo if needed
git clone git@github.com:mihaelamj/ExtremePackaging.git

# Ensure you're on the branch you want
git checkout stage/01-init-packages

# Fetch the latest version
git fetch origin

# Reset your branch to the remote version
git reset --hard stage/01-init-packages

# Delete untracked files and directories
git clean -fdx
```


To see how it looks in **Xcode** we need to switch to subfolder `packages`, since we haven’t created the workspace yet.

```bash
➜  ExtremePackaging git:(stage/01-init-packages) ✗ cd Packages
➜  Packages git:(stage/01-init-packages) ✗ xed .
```


### 1.2 Stage 02 — Add Workspace


#### Purpose

In **stage/02-workspace-added**, an Xcode **workspace** named `Main.xcworkspace` is introduced at the project root.
It includes the `Packages` folder, allowing smooth integration of multiple modules while keeping them decoupled.
This step establishes the foundation for a multi-target environment.

#### Workspace creation steps

Create a new workspace (I name it `Main`), in the root of our folder.

![](/images/xpack/workspace.png)

Add folder `Packages` to the workspace.
It will add our package structure to the project:

![](/images/xpack/Screenshot%202025-03-31%20at%2018.33.55.png)


#### Stage 02-add—to-workspace

Here’s the code for **stage 02**:

```bash

# Clone repo if needed
git clone git@github.com:mihaelamj/ExtremePackaging.git

# Ensure you're on the branch you want
git checkout stage/02-add—to-workspace

# Fetch the latest version
git fetch origin

# Reset your branch to the remote version
git reset --hard stage/02-add—to-workspace

# Delete untracked files and directories
git clean -fdx
```


Now we have the **workspace**, so we just need to open **Xcode**:

```bash
➜  Packages git:(stage/02-add—to-workspace) ✗ xed .
➜  Packages git:(stage/02-add—to-workspace) ✗
```


### 1.3 Stage 03 — Add iOS and macOS App Targets


#### Platform targets creation

**Add new iOS and a new macOS project**
Repeat this for each target:

Create a new project in Xcode:

![](/images/xpack/macos1.jpg)

![](/images/xpack/macos2.jpg)

Add each to `Apps` folder:

![](/images/xpack/macosFolder.jpg)


#### Adding them to workspace

We will be adding each app target to the workspace, below *Packages*.
Open the current repository folder and drag both new projects (iOS and macOS) into the workspace sidebar.

Each target remains isolated within its own folder, but both share the same logic through the *AppFeature* module.
This ensures that all common code — views, models, and reducers — stays within shared packages, while each platform target keeps its own configuration files.


Open the current repo folder:
![](/images/xpack/show_in_finder.jpg)

![](/images/xpack/folders_on_disk.jpg)

Add **macOS** target:

![](/images/xpack/add_macos.jpg)

Choose “Reference files in place”

![](/images/xpack/reference_files.jpg)

This is how it looks when added:

![](/images/xpack/add_macOS_done.jpg)

Add **iOS** target:

![](/images/xpack/add_iOS.jpg)

This is how it looks when added:

![](/images/xpack/add_iOS_done.jpg)


#### Explanation: Why separate targets
  
Keeping iOS and macOS projects distinct allows:
- Independent platform configuration (e.g. Info.plist, app icons, signing settings)
- Platform-specific features when needed (e.g. menu commands on macOS, touch gestures on iOS)
- Consistent architecture and shared logic through modular Swift packages

This structure aligns perfectly with the **Extreme Packaging** philosophy — shared foundation, platform-specific shells.

#### Configuration steps

- Delete automatically added `ContentView.swift`
- Add `AppFeature` package to the our target:

![](/images/xpack/AppTarget05.png)

Now our project looks like this:
![](/images/xpack/AppTarget06.png)

And the main app starts with the fully testable `AppFeature`

![](/images/xpack/AppTarget07.png)

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AppFeature

@main
struct SwiftUIAppApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            AppView()
        }
    }
}
```


#### Final structure

At this point, the project has evolved into a fully cross-platform modular setup.

The screenshot below illustrates the final structure after completing **Stage 03 (iOS & macOS targets added)**:

![](/images/xpack/final_struc.jpg)

- The **Packages** directory defines the shared Swift Package with `AppFeature` and `SharedModels` modules.
- Both **iOS** and **macOS** apps live inside the `Apps` folder, each with its own assets, entry point, and platform-specific configuration files.
- The **`Package.swift`** file defines a single modular product, with SwiftLint integrated as a plugin and dependencies kept cleanly separated.
- This structure enables both platforms to share logic and UI built with **SwiftUI**, while still allowing native customization per platform.

**Result:**
A clean, modular workspace where shared code resides in packages, and each platform acts only as a thin presentation shell — the essence of *Extreme Packaging*.

#### Stage 03-apps-added

In **stage/03-apps-added**, we create two separate app targets — one for **iOS** and one for **macOS** — both sharing the same SwiftUI core logic.

Each app lives inside the `Apps` folder and imports the `AppFeature` module, demonstrating how the same feature package can power multiple platforms with no duplicated code.

After adding the targets:
- Delete the automatically generated `ContentView.swift`
- Add the `AppFeature` package dependency to both targets
- Verify that both apps build successfully

This stage concludes with a fully functional cross-platform setup where both iOS and macOS share a unified architecture driven by modular packages.


Here’s the code for **stage 03**:

```bash

# Clone repo if needed
git clone git@github.com:mihaelamj/ExtremePackaging.git

# Ensure you're on the branch you want
git checkout stage/03-apps-added

# Fetch the latest version
git fetch origin

# Reset your branch to the remote version
git reset --hard stage/03-apps-added

# Delete untracked files and directories
git clean -fdx
```


### Summary

| Stage  | Description                   | Key Additions                                                                                  |
| :----- | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **01** | Initial package setup         | `Package.swift`, SwiftLint & SwiftFormat configs, dummy modules (`AppFeature`, `SharedModels`) |
| **02** | Workspace creation            | `Main.xcworkspace`, integrated `Packages` folder for modular management                        |
| **03** | iOS & macOS app targets added | Separate iOS and macOS apps in `Apps/`, both using `AppFeature` for shared SwiftUI logic       |

Each stage corresponds to a dedicated branch in the repository, allowing you to switch between checkpoints and observe the project’s evolution step by step.
This structure provides a transparent history of how a modular Swift project grows from a single package into a fully multi-platform architecture.

## Part 2 — Tooling

- Every project includes **SwiftLint** and **SwiftFormat** for enforcing consistent code style and quality
- Each stage of the repository introduces incremental improvements, from initializing packages to adding app targets and integrations
- These are applied from the very first stage but can be customized at any point.
